### Hi there 👋

I have [a pretty dated blog](https://olefriis.github.io).

Here are some projects that I'm really proud of:
* 🚙 [Make Stunt Car Racer run in a browser (and on your phone)](https://github.com/olefriis/stuntcarracer)
* 🎼 [Convert C-64 music to midi and Sonic Pi formats](https://github.com/olefriis/sidtool)
* 🌡️ Control your Danfoss Eco (TM) smart thermostats from your computer:
  * [Rust version](https://github.com/olefriis/Eco2-rust)
  * [C# version](https://github.com/olefriis/Eco2)
* 🌈 [Experiments with shaders](https://github.com/olefriis/misty-window)

I love doing the yearly [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) and have [my previous solutions online](https://github.com/olefriis/advent-of-code) for you to laugh at.
